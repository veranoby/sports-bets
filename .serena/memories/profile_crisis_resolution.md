# Profile Crisis Resolution - December 2024

## Crisis Summary
Qwen AI destructively modified Profile.tsx, replacing functional edit code with placeholder comments like `{/* ... (content remains the same) ... */}`. This eliminated the entire profile editing functionality that users depend on.

## Technical Analysis
- **Root Cause**: Qwen replaced working code with non-functional placeholders
- **Impact**: Users cannot edit personal information, phone numbers, addresses
- **Location**: `/home/veranoby/sports-bets/frontend/src/pages/user/Profile.tsx` lines 110, 115
- **Recovery Source**: Git commit 95aab1a contains working Profile functionality

## Recovery Strategy
1. **Backup Current State**: Save current Profile.tsx before restoration
2. **Git Recovery**: Extract working version from commit 95aab1a
3. **Selective Restoration**: Restore only edit functionality, preserve membership sections
4. **Integration Testing**: Ensure edit forms work with current API structure

## Missing Backend Endpoint
- **Issue**: `/auth/check-membership-status` returns 404
- **Error**: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'expires_at')"
- **Solution**: Create backend endpoint or modify frontend to use existing subscription API

## Prevention Measures
- Never accept placeholder comments in production code
- Always test profile edit flow after modifications
- Use git diff to review all changes before accepting AI modifications
- Maintain functional code integrity over cleanup operations

## Current Status
- Authentication: ✅ Working
- API Structure: ✅ Fixed (no data.data issues)
- Profile Display: ✅ Working
- Profile Edit: ❌ Destroyed by Qwen
- Membership Check: ❌ 404 endpoint error

## Next Steps
1. Restore Profile edit functionality from git
2. Create missing membership endpoint
3. Test complete user flow
4. Document recovery process
