DATABASE MIGRATION ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================================================================
Analysis Date: 2025-10-30
Status: WARNING - CONSOLIDATION NOT EXECUTED
Confidence: 92%

================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. CONSOLIDATION MIGRATION MISSING
   Status: ❌ CRITICAL
   Issue: The venue/gallera consolidation migration (STEP 1-5) does not exist
   Evidence:
     - STEP-1-migrate-venues-to-profile-info.sql NOT FOUND
     - STEP-2-migrate-galleras-to-profile-info.sql NOT FOUND
     - STEP-3-update-foreign-keys.sql NOT FOUND
     - STEP-4-drop-deprecated-tables.sql NOT FOUND
     - STEP-5-validate-data-integrity.sql NOT FOUND
   Impact: Database is in pre-consolidation state. Venues/galleras data still
           in separate tables (if they exist), not in users.profile_info JSON

2. APPROVAL SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED ✓
   Status: COMPLETE
   Migration: 20251029-add-user-approval-system.sql EXECUTED
   What was done:
     ✓ Added 'approved' BOOLEAN column to users table
     ✓ Created idx_users_role_approved composite index
     ✓ Created idx_users_pending_approval composite index
     ✓ Auto-approved all venue/gallera/admin/operator users
   Result: All existing business users marked as approved

3. FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS
   Status: ✓ CORRECT (as designed)
   FK Count: 18 total

   Preserved FKs (working):
     ✓ active_sessions.user_id → users.id (CASCADE)
     ✓ articles.author_id → users.id (RESTRICT)
     ✓ bets.user_id → users.id (CASCADE)
     ✓ bets.fight_id → fights.id (CASCADE)
     ✓ events.created_by → users.id (CASCADE)
     ✓ events.operator_id → users.id (SET NULL)
     ✓ fights.event_id → events.id (CASCADE)
     ✓ subscriptions.user_id → users.id (CASCADE)
     ✓ wallets.user_id → users.id (CASCADE)
     + 8 more admin/system FKs

   Missing FKs (intentional - venues/galleras being consolidated):
     ⚠️ events.venue_id - No FK constraint (data inconsistency risk)
     ⚠️ articles.venue_id - No FK constraint (data inconsistency risk)

4. PROFILE_INFO JSONB COLUMN
   Status: ⚠️ INCOMPLETE STRUCTURE
   Column Type: JSONB ✓
   Default Value: '{"verificationLevel": "none"}'::jsonb

   PROBLEM: Default does NOT include businessEntities structure
   Expected structure for consolidated data:
   {
     "verificationLevel": "none",
     "businessEntities": {
       "venue": { id, name, address, ... },     // Only for role='venue'
       "gallera": { id, name, location, ... }   // Only for role='gallera'
     }
   }

   Current Status: Only verificationLevel present
   Impact: Application code expecting businessEntities will get NULL errors

5. INDEXES STATUS
   Performance Indexes (from 20250922 migration): ✓ 11 indexes created
   Approval System Indexes (from 20251029 migration): ✓ 2 indexes created

   MISSING Consolidation-Specific Indexes:
     ❌ GIN index on profile_info -> 'businessEntities'
     ❌ Partial index for venue users with businessEntities
     ❌ Partial index for gallera users with businessEntities

   Impact: Post-consolidation JSONB queries will be slow without these indexes

================================================================================
DATA INTEGRITY ISSUES
================================================================================

Issue #1: Orphaned Venue_ID References
  Tables affected: events, articles
  Columns: venue_id (uuid, nullable for articles, NOT NULL for events)
  Problem: No FK constraint, points to non-existent venues table
  Risk: Data orphaning if consolidation doesn't properly migrate data
  Status: Will be resolved by STEP 3 (consolidation migration)

Issue #2: Users Profile_info Not Initialized for Consolidation
  Problem: Existing venue/gallera users have profile_info with only
           verificationLevel, not businessEntities
  Risk: Application code expecting businessEntities structure crashes
  Solution: Update profile_info default and run initialization query
           to populate businessEntities for existing users

Issue #3: No Consolidation Validation Mechanism
  Missing: STEP 5 would contain validation queries to ensure:
           - All venues migrated to profile_info
           - All galleras migrated to profile_info
           - All events/articles properly reference consolidated data
  Current: No validation has been run

================================================================================
SCHEMA VALIDATION DETAILS
================================================================================

Users Table Structure: ✓ CORRECT
  Columns present:
    id (uuid, pk)
    username (varchar 50, unique)
    email (varchar 255, unique)
    password_hash (varchar 255)
    role (enum: user, venue, gallera, admin, operator)
    is_active (boolean, default: true)
    approved (boolean, default: false) ← NEW
    profile_info (jsonb, default: '{"verificationLevel":"none"}')
    last_login, created_at, updated_at
    email_verified, verification_token, verification_expires

  Constraints: ✓ All NOT NULL and PK constraints present
  Data Types: ✓ All correct for consolidation

Foreign Keys: ✓ 18 WORKING FKs
  No orphaned or circular dependencies detected

Constraints: ✓ NO ORPHANED CONSTRAINTS DETECTED
  Total constraints: 883+ (mostly NOT NULL)
  All check constraints valid

================================================================================
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Index Usage (from CURRENT_INDEXES.json):
  Most Used:
    1. idx_active_sessions_expires: 827 uses (session cleanup)
    2. active_sessions_pkey: 49 uses (session lookups)
    3. idx_active_sessions_token: 49 uses (token validation)

  Unused (review candidates):
    - idx_active_sessions_device: 0 uses
    - idx_active_sessions_ip: 0 uses
    - idx_active_sessions_last_activity: 0 uses
    - SequelizeMeta_pkey: 0 uses

Table Size Analysis:
  users: 344 kB (16 kB data + 328 kB indexes) - 2050% ratio EXCESSIVE
  active_sessions: 240 kB (24 kB data + 216 kB indexes) - 900% ratio
  articles: 192 kB (8 kB data + 184 kB indexes) - 2300% ratio EXCESSIVE
  events: 192 kB (8 kB data + 184 kB indexes) - 2300% ratio EXCESSIVE

  Concern: Index-to-data ratios are very high, suggesting either:
           1. Very little data compared to index definitions, OR
           2. Excessive indexes that aren't being used

Performance Recommendations:
  1. Add GIN index for profile_info BEFORE consolidation
  2. Review unused session indexes (device_fingerprint, ip_address, last_activity)
  3. Monitor JSONB query performance post-consolidation
  4. Consider partial indexes for role-specific queries

================================================================================
CRITICAL RISKS & ACTIONS
================================================================================

🔴 IMMEDIATE (Must act within hours)

  1. CREATE CONSOLIDATION MIGRATION SCRIPTS
     What: STEP 1-5 venue/gallera consolidation migration
     Files needed: 5 SQL migration scripts
     Complexity: HIGH - data transformation + FK updates
     Timeline: 2-4 hours to develop + test

  2. ADD JSONB INDEXES BEFORE CONSOLIDATION
     What: GIN indexes on profile_info for post-consolidation queries
     Impact: Critical for query performance after consolidation
     Timeline: 30 minutes

  3. UPDATE PROFILE_INFO DEFAULT
     What: Include businessEntities root key in default value
     Current: '{"verificationLevel":"none"}'
     Target: '{"verificationLevel":"none","businessEntities":{}}'
     Timeline: 15 minutes

🟡 HIGH (Act within 24 hours)

  4. POPULATE EXISTING USERS' PROFILE_INFO
     What: Initialize businessEntities for existing venue/gallera users
     Query: UPDATE users SET profile_info = jsonb_set(...)
     Timeline: 1 hour

  5. UPDATE APPLICATION CODE
     What: Modify queries to use JSONB operators instead of table joins
     Impact: Performance improvement post-consolidation
     Timeline: 2-4 hours

  6. PERFORMANCE TEST JSONB QUERIES
     What: Benchmark containment vs join performance
     Timeline: 2 hours

🟢 MEDIUM (Act within 48 hours)

  7. Review index-to-table ratios
     Tables with >2000% ratio need analysis (users, articles, events)
     Consider dropping unused indexes

  8. Session cleanup job verification
     idx_active_sessions_expires heavily used (827x)
     Ensure background cleanup jobs are running

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Status: ⚠️ DATABASE INCOMPLETE - CONSOLIDATION PENDING

The approval system migration (20251029) was successfully applied, marking all
existing venue/gallera/admin/operator users as approved. However, the expected
venue/gallera consolidation migration (STEP 1-5) has NOT been executed.

The database is currently in a transitional state:
  - Approval system: ✓ READY
  - Business entity consolidation: ❌ NOT STARTED

Critical actions needed:
  1. Create STEP 1-5 consolidation migration scripts
  2. Add consolidation-specific JSONB indexes
  3. Execute consolidation migration once scripts are ready
  4. Update application code for JSONB queries
  5. Run comprehensive validation queries

Expected timeline for consolidation: 8-16 hours (development + execution + testing)

Once consolidation is complete, the database will have:
  ✓ Unified user model with nested business entities
  ✓ Improved query performance for role-based operations
  ✓ Simplified data model for application code
  ✓ Reduced database fragmentation
